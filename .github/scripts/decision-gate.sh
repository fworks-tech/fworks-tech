# Shared decision-gate check for agent analysis outputs.
# Sourced by .github/scripts/agent-analysis.sh and reviewer.yml.
#
# Injection model: the analysis prompt embeds untrusted material (git diffs),
# so the verdict is only trusted when it is the LAST decision block in the
# output — the agent writes its verdict at the very end, after any injected
# content. Only that final block can trip the gate. If the output contains
# MULTIPLE blocks with different verdicts, an injected block fought the real
# one — fail closed on ambiguity. A missing final block is a warning, never a
# failure, but a present-but-malformed final block fails — a truncated verdict
# must not silently pass. (Residual risk: a successfully prompt-injected agent
# that parrots a single verdict as its own final line — the prompt hardening
# in agent-analysis.sh is the defense in depth for that case.)

# Usage: check_decision_gate <output-file> [agent-name]
# Fails when the last decision block is blocking, when it reports more
# warnings than AGENTHOOD_WARNING_THRESHOLD (default 2), or when the verdict
# blocks disagree with each other.
#
# Threshold intent: the default 2 keeps the gate strict (quality debt, not
# just blocking bugs, fails the build). Consuming workflows may raise it via
# the AGENTHOOD_WARNING_THRESHOLD env var — fworks-tech's reviewer.yml sets 5
# because its LLM reviewer routinely reports 3-4 [suggestion]-grade findings
# on healthy diffs (blocking=false), which otherwise fails lightweight PRs.
# The override is documented in .github/workflows/reviewer.yml; keep both in
# sync if the policy changes.
# Fails when content other than whitespace follows the final verdict block.
# A well-formed injected marker after the real verdict is already caught by
# the conflicting-blocks check; this catches trailing junk that lacks the
# marker (defense in depth, not a second verdict detector).
